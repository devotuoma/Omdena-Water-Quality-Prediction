The Streamlit framework was utilized to create an interactive user interface for the water quality prediction system. The interface allows users to input the relevant parameters for a specific location and obtain the predicted water quality result.


## Requirements

To run the water quality prediction system locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- Streamlit

You can install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run Web Application Locally

To start the water quality prediction system, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
streamlit run main.py
```

Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. The user interface will prompt you to input the relevant parameters such as pH levels, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. After providing the required inputs, click the "Predict Water Quality" button to obtain the predicted water quality result for the specified location.
