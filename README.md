# Developing an Automated Water Quality Prediction System using Machine Learning

## The Problem
Access to clean water is a critical challenge in many parts of the world, including Rwanda. Water quality prediction is important for ensuring the availability of safe and clean water for drinking, agriculture, and other purposes. However, traditional methods for water quality prediction are often time-consuming and costly, and they may not provide accurate and timely information. To address this challenge, the Omdena Rwanda Chapter has initiated a project to develop an automated water quality prediction system using machine learning.

## The Project Goals
In this project, the Omdena Rwanda Chapter’s primary goal in this project is to develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model that can predict water quality based on a range of parameters such as Electrical conductivity of water, Amount of organic carbon in ppm, Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L, and turbidity. The model will be trained on a large dataset of historical water quality data and will be designed to provide predictions for water quality.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the [project structure](#project-structure) and [folder overview](#folder-overview) below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
